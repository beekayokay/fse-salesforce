In order to be entitled to the foregoing warranties, BUYER must notify SELLER in writing of defects within thirty (30) days of the date of discovery of same during the applicable warranty period. <strong>EXCEPT AS MAY BE OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN WRITING HEREIN, THIS WARRANTY IS PROVIDED IN LIEU OF, AND SELLER EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE.</strong> BUYER shall bear any and all costs of providing free and clear access to the GOODS and PARTS (including removal and replacement of systems and structures), de-installation, re-installation and transportation of GOODS and PARTS to SELLER and back to BUYER. No allowance will be made for repairs or alterations made by others without SELLER’S prior written consent. If repairs or alterations are attempted without SELLER’S prior written consent, this warranty shall be null and void.

In claims against any person or entity indemnified hereunder by an employee of BUYER, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by BUYER, or anyone for whose acts BUYER may be liable, the indemnification obligations of BUYER under this AGREEMENT shall not be limited by any limitation on amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for BUYER under workers’ or workmen’s compensation acts, disability benefit acts or other employee benefit acts.
                    <br/>
                    <strong>12. <u>UNLAWFUL CONDUCT</u></strong>: BUYER warrants and covenants that it will not violate any applicable law or regulation of any country or political subdivision thereof, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in performing or purporting to perform any act arising out of or in connection with this AGREEMENT.

                    <strong>14. <u>GENERAL PROVISIONS / ENTIRE AGREEMENT</u></strong>: Except as otherwise provided herein, these terms and conditions and the face of BUYER’S purchase order to SELLER (and if the Agreement is for SERVICES, SELLER’S applicable Labor Rate Sheet) shall constitute the entire agreement between BUYER and SELLER and can only be modified by a writing signed by duly authorized representatives of both BUYER and SELLER. Should any part of the AGREEMENT be deemed invalid by a court of law that shall not constitute an invalidation of any other part of the AGREEMENT. Section headings are for purposes of guidance only and are not to be considered a part of the AGREEMENT. SELLER’S acceptance of BUYER’S purchase order is expressly made conditional on BUYER’S assent to these terms and conditions and the rejection of any other terms and conditions. Acceptance by BUYER of GOODS, PARTS, or SERVICES shall constitute unequivocal acceptance of these terms and conditions. Past practice, industry standards or practices or previous course of dealing or trade shall not supersede or replace these terms or conditions. Failure of SELLER to effect any available right or remedy shall not operate as a waiver of same. BUYER acknowledges the import of these terms and conditions and understands the contractual obligations created.
